# Final Project - UCSD Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp

# Using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict Customer Satisfaction, Repeat Customers, and Purchase Recommendations

For the final project required by the UCSD Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp, my team posed as a ficticious ecommerce consulting firm (Lazuli), analyzing transaction data on behalf of an imaginary marketplace website. Our charter was to use machine learning to make predictions, which we were able to do with customer satisfaction (linear regression) and likelihood of repeat transactions (logistic regression).
